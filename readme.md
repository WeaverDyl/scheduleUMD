# ScheduleUMD

A command-line tool to assist students at The University of Maryland who want to get into specific classes.

## What This Does

Eventually, ScheduleUMD will have a suite of features, the main one being the ability to notify a user via email or text message that a class that they're interested in went from being full to having an open seat.

## More to Come

The API that's being used ([UMD.io](https://github.com/umdio/umdio)) seems to be having issues with returning accurate, up-to-date course data. Until this is fixed, this program will not be very useful.
