A command-line tool to assist students at The University of Maryland who want to get into specific classes.

## What This Does

Eventually, ScheduleUMD will have a suite of features, the main one being the ability to notify a user via email or text message that a class that they're interested in went from being full to having an open seat.

## Usage
Coming soon.
